# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
## Description: 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the
world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 million people
in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control.
These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the
breast area. The key challenges against its detection are how to classify tumors
into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

## Steps:

### Step 1: Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset.

### Step 2: Checking missing values and Outliers & Creating visual methods to analyze the data.

### Step 3: Definining Exploratory Data Analysis with an overview of the whole project .
### Step 4: creat a model that fits the data
   - LogisticRegression
   - SVM
   - DecisionTree
   - KNN

### Step 5: creating an accurecy table
